You recieve the sessionend file from the radius server
you check if the access point id exists on the server
You parse the id of the student and the access point you recieved it from and the session duration
and you check if the acces_point id exists in the cached ids which are only the access points at lecture or class rooms or labs 
if true:
   you cache it because when session ends usually the number of students who would disconnect at once from all over the campus would be great so processing each one is       not ideal
after the cached logs reach 50 you insert them at once 
if false:
    ignore the log
after each period 
    you get all the lectures with the same current end datetime  
    you create a join table which includes the student id ,class id , session duration,class name, access point id, class type (wether it was a lecture or a section), and           class duration
    then check the percentage that each student lasted in the room and insert them into the db
